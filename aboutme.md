Hi. My name is Kevin Riady. I am a graduate from McMaster University with a double major in Electrical and Biomedical Engineering.

In 2019, I worked at the Independent Electricity System Operator, a corporation that manages our province's electricity system. As an Analyst, I contributed to both major and minor investigations involving Ontario generators, loads and energy traders by leveraging data analytic tools such as Python, SQL, Excel, and Tableau. I have gained incredible insights into both the Ontario Electricity Grid and its corresponding Electricity Markets (not a typo, thereâ€™s more than one!).

In my undergraduate, I had maintained sessional GPAs of 3.7 and 3.9 in my first and final year respectively. I was also involved at a leadership capacity in three different student clubs namely Hamilton CCF, SHINE, and Leaders in Global Health Transformation.

I am known for being a great team player and collaborator. I believe that innovation comes from putting people of diverse backgrounds and experiences into the same team. I've also found that I'm able to learn a great deal from others and work well with them simply by listening actively and leaning onto their strengths and passions.

I delight in learning and gaining new skills. Since graduation, I have completed a Hackathon (Hack Instead) and developed a number of industry-specific skills such as (1) Python for Data Science & Machine Learning, (2) Full Stack JavaScript (still a novice!), and (3) AWS as a cloud technology. These are all in addition to the numerous technical and analytical skills that I've gained from being an Elec. & Biomed. Engineering student.

My true home is in South East Asia. Born in Indonesia, grew up in Singapore, and now living in Canada. Since 2010, I've travelled to Singapore over 6x! I look to capitalize on the global background that I've been lucky to have received.
